                This section is intended to be very similar to what you can find
                on my resume. I list my academic background, as well as my past
                job experiences with brief descriptions. When coupled with the
                content found in the skills section, it should form a more
                complete picture of my professionally diverse past. I have been
                on a journey to discover what I am passionate about, and this
                journey has brought me to the doorstep of the tech industry.
